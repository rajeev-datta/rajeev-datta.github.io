With climate change remaining a monumental challenge for current and future generations, there has been continued
interest in novel ways to mitigate carbon emissions. One of the more popular approaches is ``green”-ifying electric grids,
incorporating renewable energy sources. The inherent volatility of such grids motivates the need for a better understanding
of the grid’s hierarchy and the ability to simulate complex algorithms on these grids. For such analysis, accurate digital
models are necessary. Unfortunately, traditional methods of annotating and, subsequently, digitizing physical single-line
diagrams are tedious. Our project aims to combat this time and energy waste with an easy-to-use user interface for annotating
and digitizing single-line diagrams using computer vision techniques.
