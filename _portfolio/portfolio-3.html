Our project for this hands-on robotics course was a robotic arm that
could stack square quadros (large LEGO blocks) on a 3-D printed baseplate.
The robot would track placed quadros in the workspace using a camera positioned above the robot 
and continually stack them on available stacks of quadros on the baseplate.
During execution, we anticipated a set of reasonable actions people would take
when interacting with the robotic system. Our system handled if someone moves
the location of a block during execution. Specifically, if a block is moved into the workspace,
the camera system detects the additional block and updates the available blocks for the robot to
sample and place from. If a block instead moved into the stacking workspace (the area defined by a clamped baseplate),
our system would recognize the placed block as the start of a new stack and add it to
the plausible stacks to sample from and stack onto. Someone can even be particularly mean
and remove a block from an existing stack. In such a case, the detector system will update
the stack height and continue stacking onto the newly altered stack in future time steps.
Lastly, using a depth camera, people could stack blocks in workspace and the robot would, if sampling a stack,
stack the highest block in the chosen stack.
