The lack of standardized benchmarks for reinforcement learning (RL) in sustainability applications has made it difficult to both
track progress on specific domains and identify bottlenecks for researchers to focus their efforts.
In this paper, we present SustainGym, a suite of five environments designed to test the performance of RL algorithms on
realistic sustainable energy system tasks, ranging from electric vehicle charging to carbon-aware data center job scheduling.
The environments test RL algorithms under realistic distribution shifts as well as in multi-agent settings.
We show that standard off-the-shelf RL algorithms leave significant room for improving performance and highlight the challenges
ahead for introducing RL to real-world sustainability tasks.
